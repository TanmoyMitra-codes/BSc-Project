# Sustainable Sanitary Pads from Cotton Textile Waste

## Project Title
**A Sustainable Approach: A Scope of Using Solid Textile Cotton Wastage in Hygiene Product (Sanitary Pad) Manufacturing**

## Overview
This project explores the innovative use of cotton-based textile waste as a sustainable, low-cost alternative to synthetic superabsorbent polymers (SAP) in the production of sanitary pads. The aim is to reduce environmental impact and increase accessibility to menstrual hygiene products, especially in resource-constrained communities.

## Objectives
- Develop sanitary pads using recycled textile cotton waste.
- Provide an affordable solution for menstrual hygiene.
- Reduce the volume of textile waste and promote sustainable manufacturing.

## Motivation
Bangladesh's textile industry produces over 351,000 tons of waste annually. Utilizing this waste for hygiene products can significantly:
- Lower production costs,
- Minimize environmental pollution,
- Reduce dependency on imported materials like fluff pulp and SAP.

## Raw Materials
- Cotton waste from:  
  - Spinning Industry  
  - Knitting Industry  
  - Weaving Industry  
  - Garment Industry

## Production Process
1. **Waste Collection & Preparation**  
   - Cutting  
   - Tearing  
   - Opening & Cleaning  
2. **Material Processing**  
   - Bleaching  
   - Trash Analysis  
   - Carding  
3. **Pad Manufacturing**  
   - Crashing  
   - Compressing  
   - Wrapping  
   - Sterilizing  
   - Packaging

## Product Testing
The pads underwent several performance and safety tests:
- Absorption Capacity Test (Average: 111.75 mL)
- pH Test (Average: 7.03; within safe range)
- Pressure Retention Test
- Penetration Time Test (Average: 4.69 sec)
- Antimicrobial Test

## Cost Analysis
- Average cost of one pad: **BDT 2.16**
- Competitive edge: Significantly lower than popular commercial brands

## Future Prospects
- Optimize performance by mixing fluff pulp in varying ratios.
- Explore biodegradable materials for outer layers.
- Extend the approach to other hygiene products like diapers.
